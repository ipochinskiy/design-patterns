# Interpreter

The Interpreter pattern offers a scripting language that allows end-users to customize their solution.

Some applications are so complex that they require advanced configuration. You could offer a basic scripting language which allows the end-user to manipulate your application through simple instructions. The Interpreter pattern solves this particular problem â€“ that of creating a simple scripting language.

Certain types of problems lend themselves to be characterized by a language. This language describes the problem domain which should be well-understood and well-defined. To implement this you need to map the language to a grammar. Grammars are usually hierarchical tree-like structures that step through multiple levels and then end up with terminal nodes (also called literals).

Problems like this, expressed as a grammar, can be implemented using the Interpreter design pattern.

Today, if you really need this type of control in JavaScript it is probably easier to use a code generator like ANTLR which will allow you to build your own command interpreters based on a grammar that you provide.

## Participants

The objects participating in this pattern are:
* Client -- in sample code: the run() program.
	* builds (or is given) a syntax tree representing the grammar
	* establishes the initial context
	* invokes the interpret operations
* Context -- in sample code: Context
	* contains state information to the interpreter
* TerminalExpression -- in sample code: Expression
	* implements an interpret operation associated with terminal symbols in the grammar
	* one instance for each terminal expression in the sentence
* NonTerminalExpression -- in sample code: not used
	* implements an interpret operation associated for non-terminal symbols in the grammar

The objective of this example is to build an interpreter which translates roman numerals to decimal numbers: for example, XXXVI = 36.

The Context object maintains the input (the roman numeral) and the resulting output as it is being parsed and interpreted. The Expression object represents the nodes in the grammar tree; it supports the interpret method.

When running the program, a simple grammar tree is being built which then processes a roman numeral and translates it into a numeric.
